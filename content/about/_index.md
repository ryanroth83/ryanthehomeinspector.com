A.K.A "Ryan The Home Inspector"

Born and rasied outside of Cincinnati, Ohio. and moved to Houston in 2017. After having many issue after purching a new build house I reliezed the importance of a home inspection. I, as many people still think, thought that a new build house would not need me to have inspected. I was under the impression that city/county perfomred all the required inspections.
