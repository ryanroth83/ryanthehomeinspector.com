  - name: "Andrew Graesser"
    description: "Maintenance Inspection"
    location: "Katy, TX"

    content: "I highly recommend Ryan Roth for your inspection needs! He is extremely knowledgeable and thorough and will be honest about the property of inspection, which is exactly what I look for in an inspector. I asked Ryan to complete a property inspection for my home in Katy so I would know where to focus my efforts with any maintenance items or potential risks upcoming.  He has a great understanding of all home systems and was able to recognize several things that I needed to get done to prevent future issues down the road which more than paid for the cost of the inspection itself.  Ryan is very transparent in his pricing and a good communicator from start to finish."
