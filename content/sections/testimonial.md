testimonials:
  - name: "Andrew"
    description: "Maintenance Inspection"
    location: "Katy, TX"

    content: "I highly recommend Ryan Roth for your inspection needs! He is extremely knowledgeable and thorough and will be honest about the property of inspection, which is exactly what I look for in an inspector. I asked Ryan to complete a property inspection for my home in Katy so I would know where to focus my efforts with any maintenance items or potential risks upcoming.  He has a great understanding of all home systems and was able to recognize several things that I needed to get done to prevent future issues down the road which more than paid for the cost of the inspection itself.  Ryan is very transparent in his pricing and a good communicator from start to finish."

    content: "Ryan is the best inspector we ever had! Heâ€™s so detailed and picked up on errors the other inspectors we used completely overlooked. Being a first time homeowner, he was also very thorough and patient with us, explaining everything to us in detail. He went above and beyond by spending over an hour of his time beyond the inspection, solely to teach us things about being homeowners and what to watch out for. He also gave us tips on house upkeeping/maintenance and how to avoid expensive costs for the future. He provides great pictures with arrows/circles and meticulous explanations in every report. I cannot emphasize what a genuine and intelligent person he is. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!"
