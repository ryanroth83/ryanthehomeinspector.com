### What is a WDI inspection?

WDI stands for Wood Destroying Inspections, sometimes you may see it written as WDO for Wood Destroying Organisms. Basically is an inspection for termites and other critters that destroy wood.

### Who can perform WDI inspections?

In the state of Texas only licensed pest control applicators can perform WDI inspections. This license is issued by the Texas Department of Agriculture and requires specific insurance. Legally a home inspector in the state of Texas cannot identify wood destroying insects without a license issued by The Texas Department of Agriculture and specific insurance.

### How do other home inspectors perform WDI inspections?

Some home inspectors go through the application process and become a licensed pest control applicator or work under the license of an applicator as an apprentice to perform these inspections themselves.

### How does Ryan The Home Inspector do it?

I have partnered with a local, family-owned pest control company to perform my WDI inspection. This way my client will have an experienced pest control applicator inspect and report on insect activity. That gives me the ability to focus on the the structural inspection and this gives my client a second set of eyes with an additional set of skills and experience.

### What do you need to do?

Just check the box to schedule the WDI inspection when you schedule your home inspection, I will take care of the rest. We have worked together to streamline the scheduling and payment systems to provide a seamless experience & a competitive rate, that is even cheaper then some competitors that don't have a dedicated insect inspector come out.
