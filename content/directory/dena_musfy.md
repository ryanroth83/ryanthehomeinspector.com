Dena Musfy has a decade of professional recruiting experience in two major industries. With this foundation, Dena possesses the skillset to connect buyers to the right house and neighborhood or lot and builder, and to identify the target buyers for her sellers. She recognizes the immediate needs of her sellers and is able to offer a high level of concierge services to get their home ready for the market and make it a smooth transaction all the way through closing "I do more than simply help clients sell or purchase a house," Dena says. "I focus on promoting Houston, the city I know and love."

Dena graduated from Bellaire High School and earned a degree in communications from the University of Houston. A proud native Houstonian, she is active in the social and volunteer scene, is extremely personable, and has, according to her growing network of loyal clients, "never met a stranger." She volunteers for the PR and media team of the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Wine Events Committee and for the Houston General Go Texan Committee.

"Rodeo is a fun tradition in Houston but people forget that the focus is to raise money for education/scholarships," Dena says. Her additional volunteer commitments include Shady Acres Civic Association President, Business Network International (BNI) Realtor Chair, BNI Network in Action Realtor® Chair and The Womens Council of Realtors®.

Residents of Shady Acres, Dena and her husband have a young daughter who attends St. Matthews CDC. She enjoys Pilates, keeping up with Houston's restaurant scene, and biking through parks with her family.
