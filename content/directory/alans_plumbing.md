If you had to pick two, which two would you pick? Service and quality? Quality and price? Master Plumber Alan Burkhalter, founder of local Alan's Plumbing, says, “Here at Alan’s Plumbing, we strive for all three!”
Think about it this way: If you want a good meal, it takes some time to prepare and cook it. When you’re in a hurry, you might go to a fast food restaurant, but the food isn’t nearly as good as it could have been if freshly prepared. You may have spent a small amount of money, but it’s a relatively unappetizing meal. Alan says, “My guys and I have been doing plumbing work here in Fort Bend County for a long time. We’ve seen the work performed by ‘fast food’ contractors. The result is very similar to a low-quality meal, The price wasn’t that much less, and the quality is never as good.”
A long time indeed. Back in the beginning (about 30 years ago!), the Alan's Plumbing team consisted of only Alan and his wife Jennifer. Jennifer answered the calls, and Alan provided service for those calls. Today, Alan's brother Chris works alongside Alan's two oldest sons, Beau and Luke, while their youngest son, Jake, does plumbing sales in Houston. This dynamic team includes longtime plumbers Jaime, Christian, Anthony, and brothers Nick and Noah, with Jennifer running the back office and longtime family friend Katie and new team member Katy as the voices behind the phones.
Alan says, “A friend recently told me that he saw a plumber who does it all at rock bottom prices. His strategy? He purchases the materials for his jobs at a bargain store. My friend could not believe it. I laughed, because I could believe it. The boys and I have seen his work, and we’re often called in to repair it.”
“The truth is,” continues Alan, “people often forget how fast you did a job. But they do remember how well you did it, and they tell their friends. We strive to provide good work, and you’ve told your neighbors. For that, we thank you, Fort Bend County!”  
Get it right the first time. From plumbing emergencies and remodels to hot water heater installations, water pressure issues, and leaky pipes, choose quality, service, AND price. Choose local
