Mama Bear Pest & Outdoor is more than just a pest control company; we’re your partners in creating a healthier, safer home environment. Founded by someone with a lifelong background in construction, our journey into the pest control realm began three years ago with a prominent pest control company. Armed with hands-on experience and a commitment to eco-friendly practices, we ventured into the world of green pest control. Our technicians are licensed through the Texas Department of Agriculture, and we bring a unique blend of construction know-how and pest management expertise to Katy, TX.
###### <br>
What sets us apart is not just our technical proficiency but also our family-oriented approach. As a woman-owned and family-operated business, we understand the importance of a home that is not only pest-free but also safe for your loved ones, including furry friends. Our services go beyond traditional pest control; we specialize in green pest solutions, rodent and wildlife exclusion, termite treatments, and more. We’re not just here to eliminate pests; we’re here to provide peace of mind.
###### <br>
At Mama Bear, we pride ourselves on being a local, affordable, and customizable solution for your pest control needs. We believe that a pest-free home shouldn’t come at the expense of the environment, which is why we are dedicated to using plant-based pesticides and green technologies as part of our pest control services. Your satisfaction and peace of mind are at the core of our mission. Join us on this journey towards a pest-free, environmentally conscious home – where clean meets Katy, TX.
