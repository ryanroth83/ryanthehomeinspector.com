Hi, I'm Michelle Roth, a realtor based in Houston, Texas, and the proud owner of "Texas Mama Sells Homes". I'm not just a realtor, though- I'm also a mom of four and a wife. My family means everything to me, and I believe that my experience as a mom has given me a unique perspective on what families are looking for in a home.
 
As a realtor, I understand the importance of effective communication and great negotiation skills. I believe that these skills are crucial when it comes to buying and selling homes. I am always committed to providing exceptional service to my clients and strive to make the process as stress-free as possible. 
 
I'm passionate about what I do, and I believe that my success as a realtor comes from my ability to connect with people.  My client's are just customers to me - they're friends. I love getting to know them and helping them find the perfect place to call home. 
 
If you are looking for a realtor that truly cares about your needs, and will go above and beyond for you, then look no further than Texas Mama Sells Homes. I am committed to making your home-buying or selling experience a success. Let's work together to make your dreams a reality!
