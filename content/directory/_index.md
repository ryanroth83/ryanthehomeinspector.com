Directory of trusted professionals available to anyone, created for the benefit of my clients. I maintain this directory at no cost and expect nothing in return other than honest and quality services with open communication and willingness to correct any issue on the behalf of the client in a timely manner.

    bulletpoints:
      - "I have a trusted relationship with everyone listed in this directory."
      - "Everyone listed provides the same quality and honest service I would provide myself."
      - "I have a direct contact if my client has any issues."
      - "I am able to directly communicate to the provider the details of my clients needs."
      - "I do not receive any referral fee or any other kind of compensation from those listed."
