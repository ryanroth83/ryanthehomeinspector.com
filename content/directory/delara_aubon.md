Dedicated and passionate about elevating industry standards, driving growth, and fostering meaningful connections, I strive to be a leader and innovator in all my business pursuits. With over 20 years of experience in sales, and more than a decade in various sectors of the real estate industry, my journey has been marked by strategic leadership, innovative business development, and a commitment to education and collaboration. 
Throughout my career, I have managed diverse teams and led comprehensive sales strategies, resulting in exceptional growth locally and across the state. My focus on inspired and effective leadership, onboarding, coaching, and fostering a culture of continuous learning has empowered sales teams and resulted in the growth of revenue and brand visibility.
In previous roles, I spearheaded expansion efforts into new markets, fostering connections with realtors, builders, brokers, developers and investors through strategic networking and recruiting of talent. I am committed to boosting brand presence through targeted events, personalized engagements and the leveraging of my personal network across the state and nation.
My involvement with the Women’s Council of REALTORS® has allowed me to shape industry leadership and direction. From leadership and strategic directives as a Governor for the state to advocacy within the Houston Association of REALTORS® Political Affairs Advisory Group, I am committed to driving positive change and elevating industry standards.
Education is a driving force in my journey. I have pioneered courses, coached privately and corporately, conducted interviews with industry experts, and organized educational sessions. I am also the founder of RealNet™ Networking, a platform that fosters growth through intentional referral programs and partnerships. Through Aubon Achievement Advisors™ I have offered coaching and mentorship to enable the professional growth and advancements of small and large business owners alike.
As a public speaker, I have had the opportunity to share insights on local, state and national stages, empowering and inspiring professionals to excel in their business. These engagements have allowed me to facilitate and create events featuring top tier professionals and local officials bringing value to the business community
Let us connect and collaborate on building a dynamic future for your business. Whether it be fostering partnerships, advocating for industry interests, or driving strategic growth, I am committed to making a lasting impact and leaving a legacy of innovation through collaboration.
