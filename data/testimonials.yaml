    I highly recommend Ryan Roth for your inspection needs! He is extremely knowledgeable
    and thorough and will be honest about the property of inspection, which is exactly
    what I look for in an inspector. I asked Ryan to complete a property inspection
    for my home in Katy so I would know where to focus my efforts with any maintenance
    items or potential risks upcoming. He has a great understanding of all home systems
    and was able to recognize several things that I needed to get done to prevent
    future issues down the road which more than paid for the cost of the inspection
    itself. Ryan is very transparent in his pricing and a good communicator from
    start to finish.

    Ryan is the best inspector we ever had! He’s so detailed and very knowledgeable
    about his field. His inspection report and comments were very thorough and clear.
    He genuinely cares about his customers, their time, and that they’re getting quality
    service. He even spent time with us after the inspection, walking us through
    items we were not familiar with as first-time homebuyers. He continued to advise us
    beyond the inspection, solely to teach us things about being homeowners and what
    to watch out for. He also gave us tips on house upkeeping/maintenance and how
    to avoid expensive costs for the future. He provides great pictures with arrows/circles
    and meticulous explanations in every report. I cannot emphasize what a genuine
    and intelligent person he is. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!

    My buyer was on a deadline and Ryan made it happen same day. He was thorough
    and efficient. When my client got the report, we were thrilled with the level
    of detail. I will definitely be referring future clients to him!

    Ryan did a great job with the inspection. His report was clear and straight to the point
    about the issues and recommendations. He took the time to explain everything and showed
    where my builder needed to make changes. After the inspection, he followed up and made sure
    I was comfortable with everything.

    I called Ryan to help with a vacant listing where the glass had shattered on a sliding door.
    Ryan was quick to help and got over to the house in less than 30 minutes to assess what needed
    to be done. He's reliable and efficient with his work. I highly recommend using Ryan!

    I had a great experience with Ryan for our new construction inspection. Ryan was extremely
    professional and timely, and he uncovered several potentially costly defects that we
    wouldn't have noticed on our own. Highly recommend!
